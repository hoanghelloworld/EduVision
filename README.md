## Dataset
3.4 million image-text pairs, including both handwritten mathematical expressions (200,330 examples) and printed mathematical expressions (3,237,250 examples)

[- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rvente/im2latex170k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/hoang-quoc-trung/fusion-image-to-latex-datasets)

Printed mathematical expressions: We collect from Im2latex-100k dataset [1], I2L-140K Normalized dataset and Im2latex-90k Normalized dataset [2], Im2latex-170k dataset 3, Im2latex-230k dataset 4, latexformulas dataset 5 and Im2latex dataset 6.

Handwritten mathematical expressions: We collected data from the Competition on Recognition of Online Handwritten Mathematical Expressions (CROHME) dataset [7, 8, 9], Aida Calculus Math Handwriting Recognition Dataset [10] and Handwritten Mathematical Expression Convert LaTeX [11].
